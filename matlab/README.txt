1. Geometric and Kinematic Variables
	O: Origin point of the robotic system, used as a reference point for calculations. It’s set to [0, 0, 0], representing a 3D coordinate system’s origin.
	R, r: Radii used in trajectory calculations. R is the larger radius and r is the smaller one, affecting how the robot's arm extends or contracts.
	d, h: Parameters defining distances in the kinematic model. d might represent distance between joints or pivotal points, and h could be a height or depth parameter depending on the robot's configuration.
	alpha, beta: Arrays defining angles for rotation matrices. These are crucial for calculating the orientation of different robotic arm segments relative to each other.

2. Matrix Variables for Rotation and Position
	A, B: Initial position vectors for certain points or joints in the robot's arm.
	RA1, RA2, RA3, RB1, RB2, RB3: Rotation matrices applied to the initial position vectors A and B to calculate new positions as the robot moves. These matrices are recalculated whenever the arm's configuration changes due to motion.
	A1, A2, A3: Resultant position vectors after applying the rotation matrices to A.

3. Dynamic Variables for Real-Time Operation
	sample_trajectory: This variable might store a graphical object or data points representing the trajectory being simulated. It is used for updating the visual representation in the UIAxes (simulation).
	ESP_serial: Represents the serial port connection to an ESP device, used for sending commands and receiving data to control a real or simulated robotic system.


4. UI State Variables
	ESPConsoleEditField: Edit field in the UI for displaying messages or data read from the ESP serial port, useful for debugging and monitoring the system’s status.
	OutwardSerialEditField: Edit field for showing the command string or data sent to the ESP, providing a clear view of the output being transmitted.
	NooflinesEditField: Numeric edit field where users specify the number of points or segments in the trajectory, allowing for finer or coarser resolution of the path.

5. Control Variables
	theta_sw: A variable likely used to store calculated joint angles (θ) for the robotic system. It's crucial for controlling the exact position and orientation of robotic arms.

6. Temporary and Helper Variables
pos, C1, C2, C3: Temporarily hold calculated positions or intermediate points in the trajectory. These are recalculated in real-time based on inputs and serial data.
u1, u2, u3: Vectors used in calculating the circumcenter, a geometric computation perhaps used for determining the central point of a circular trajectory or for balancing forces/torques in the robot's structure.

Detailed Component Explanation
1. UI Components
	UIFigure: This is the main window or frame of the MATLAB app. It contains all other UI components like buttons, edit fields, and axes for plotting.
	NumericEditField (e.g., NooflinesEditField, InputxEditField):
	These fields accept numerical inputs from users, which dictate parameters like the number of trajectory segments or specific coordinates.
Button:
	StartButton: Triggers the execution of the trajectory using the parameters specified in the UI. It interacts with the serial port to send these parameters to a connected device (like an ESP32).
	ResetButton: Resets all the input fields and the simulation plot to their default states, allowing for a new setup without restarting the app.
	EnterButton: Computes the trajectory based on the current input values and updates the simulation plot accordingly.


2. Button Groups for Mode Selection
	InputxButtonGroup, InputyButtonGroup, InputzButtonGroup:
	These groups contain radio buttons to select whether the motion along each axis (x, y, z) should be linear or circular. This affects how the trajectory is calculated and plotted.
	CircularButton and LinearButton within these groups allow for dynamic selection between different types of motion paths.

3. Simulation Axes (simulation):
	A UIAxes component that visualizes the trajectory in a 3D space. It shows how the input parameters translate into movement paths for the robotic system being simulated.
	Detailed Functionality Explanation
		1. Startup Function
			Initializes serial communication on a specific COM port at a defined baud rate, allowing MATLAB to send and receive data from a microcontroller like an ESP32.
			Sets up initial geometrical parameters for the robotic system (like arm lengths and angles), which are crucial for calculating the initial state of the robot in the simulation.
		2. Trajectory Calculation and Simulation
			When the EnterButton is pushed:
			Depending on the selected mode (linear or circular), trajectory points are calculated. For circular motion, points are calculated using trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) based on radius and angle inputs. 			For linear motion, points are generated between start and end values linearly spaced.
			These points are then used to compute inverse kinematics of the robotic system, which essentially calculates the joint angles needed to achieve each point in the trajectory.
			The simulation plot is updated with these points, visually depicting the trajectory in 3D.

4. Real-Time Serial Communication
	Data is continuously read from and written to the serial port:
	Reading: The app reads incoming serial data (like sensor readings or status updates from the ESP32), which can be used to adjust the simulation or displayed in the console for debugging.
	Writing: Commands and trajectory data are sent over serial to control the physical robot or another simulation system that uses this data to perform real-world or simulated movements.

5. Dynamic Update of Trajectory
	As the ESP sends back real-time data or as parameters are adjusted in the app, the plotted trajectory and the positions of the robotic arms in the simulation are dynamically updated. This allows for interactive and responsive testing of robotic control algorithms.

Usage Tips
	Users can experiment with different trajectories by changing the numeric values and selecting between linear or circular paths for each axis.
	Watching the simulation can provide intuitive feedback on how changes in parameters affect the movement, which is valuable for educational and debugging purposes.
	It's important to ensure that the serial settings in MATLAB match those of the connected device to avoid communication issues.
